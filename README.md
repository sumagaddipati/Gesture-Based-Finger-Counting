🔧 Installation

1️⃣ Install dependencies:

pip install opencv-python mediapipe numpy

2️⃣ Run the script:

python finger_counting.py

🛠 Usage

Show your hand in front of the webcam ✋

The script detects and displays the number of fingers raised

Press 'q' to exit

📜 Code Overview

The script captures video from the webcam and uses MediaPipe Hands to detect hand landmarks. It then checks the position of each finger to determine whether it is raised or folded, and counts the number of raised fingers.

Key Functions:

Hand Tracking: Uses MediaPipe to detect hand landmarks in real-time.

Finger Status Detection: Determines whether each finger is up or down.

Finger Counting: Counts the number of fingers raised and displays the result.

Real-Time Display: Continuously updates the count based on hand gestures.
